    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe history of energy production can be traced back for thousands of years, and it serves as an important mark for the advancement in human culture, technology, and civilizations. Energy is not only crucial for our daily lives, but also serving for the foundation In recent decades, various sources for energy production have received attentions from scientists worldwide for different purposes. For a long time, fossil fuels have been the primary sources for energy, and yet the public have criticized its consequences on environmental harm and climate changes. In addition, due to the limited storage of fossil fuels on this planet, sustainable alternatives for coals and petroleum have been pushed to the to-do list. To this end, renewable sources, like hydro and solar power, have joined the stage. Other scientists have looked into fuels with higher energy density and starts to look for sites for nuclear power plants. All of those changes and development contributed to other changes in social, economic, and geopolitical changes which shaped our community.\nIn this project, we aim to gain insights on the change in sources of energy consumption and production over the past several decades in United States. We are interested in understanding and visualizing trends, if any, in preferences for sources of energy generated or used, as well as any seasonal or periodic rise or fall in total production or consumption of energy. We expect, through such study, to learn more about the emphasis of various sources of energy and consumption have evolved over time and help us visualize the future.",

The publication includes total energy production, consumption, stocks, and trade; energy prices; overviews of petroleum, natural gas, coal, electricity, nuclear energy, renewable energy, and carbon dioxide emissions; and data unit conversions values.\nFor this project, we have the compiled 20 different data files ranging from fossil fuels production and consumption, monthly energy consumption, CO2 emissions to renewable energy, electricity prices and many more till July 2024. This data will be used to perform data analysis and visualization.\nMore granular data on each energy source can be found in the following link: https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/browser/",

For this project, we have downloaded around 20 excel and csv files and did initial analysis on the missing data in each of this excel files. Then we have combined the data from all the excel files into a single excel file for easy processing and analysis of the data.",

A more efficient approach is to consolidate all the data into a single table structure. By doing so, we eliminate the need for complex and computationally expensive join operations, simplify the workflow, and significantly reduce the amount of code required to process and analyze the data.

Initially, there is a steady increase from approximately 28 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to 59 quadrillion Btu by 1970. This is followed by a plateau in production from 1970 to 2010. After 2010, there is a noticeable spike in production, which may be attributed to advancements in high-performance computing in large data centers which needs high energy.\nFossil Fuels Production : This line shows a significant increase over the years, indicating a substantial rise in energy production. It suggests that this energy source has been the dominant contributor to primary energy production.\nNuclear and Renewable Energy Production : These lines remain relatively flat compared to the fossil fuel, indicating that these energy sources have contributed less to the overall primary energy production. They show slight increases over time but are not as pronounced as the fossil fuel.\n\n\n3.2.2 Primary Energy Consumption\n\n\nCode\nggplot(energy_data_annual, aes(x=Year)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=`Total Fossil Fuels Consumption (Quadrillion Btu)`, color='Fossil Fuels Consumption'), size=1) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=`Nuclear Electric Power Consumption (Quadrillion Btu)`, color='Nuclear Power Consumption'), size=1) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=`Total Renewable Energy Consumption (Quadrillion Btu)`, color='Renewable Energy Consumption'), size=1) +\n  labs(\n    title='Primary Energy Consumption',\n    x='Year',\n    y='Consumption (Quadrillion Btu)',\n    caption = 'Data Source: U.S. Energy Information Association'\n  ) + \n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\n      'Fossil Fuels Consumption' = 'red',\n      'Nuclear Power Consumption' = 'blue',\n      'Renewable Energy Consumption' = 'green'\n    )\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold', color='black'),\n    legend.position = 'bottom',\n    legend.box = 'horizontal',\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFossil Fuels Consumption : This is the dominant source of energy consumption throughout the period. There is a steady increase from 1950 to around 2005, with some fluctuations. After 2005, the consumption plateaus with minor ups and downs.\nNuclear Power Consumption : This energy consumption starts to become little significant around the late 1960s and early 1970s. It shows gradual growth until about 2000, after which it stabilizes.\nRenewable Energy Consumption : This energy consumption begins to rise noticeably in the late 1990s. It shows a steady increase, especially post-2000, and appears to be catching up with nuclear power by the end of the period.\nThe fossil fuels make a large chunk of energy consumption throughout the years. The other energy consumption source like nuclear and renewable has very little contribution. There is a serious need of investments in these energy sources in order to catch up or reduce the dependence of fossil fuels.\n\n\n3.2.3 Primary Energy Imports and Exports\n\n\nCode\nggplot(energy_data_annual, aes(x=Year, y=`Primary Energy Net Imports (Quadrillion Btu)`)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill='orange', color='black') + \n  labs(\n    title='Primary Energy Net Imports',\n    x = 'Year',\n    y = 'Energy (Quadrillion Btu)',\n    caption = 'Data Source: U.S. Energy Information Associaton'\n  ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold', color='black'),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart shows the net imports of primary energy into the United States over time.\nObservations :\n\n1950s to Early 1970s: The net energy imports were relatively low and stable. This period shows minimal dependency on energy imports.\nMid-1970s to Early 1980s: There was a noticeable increase in net energy imports, likely due to rising energy demands and geopolitical events affecting oil supply. Since the 1970s, the global oil trade has been predominantly conducted in U.S. dollars (USD), creating a symbiosis between America’s currency and the world’s most traded commodity. The petrodollar emerged as an economic concept in the 1970s as growing U.S. imports of increasingly costly crude oil increased the dollar holdings of foreign producers.\n1980s to Early 2000s: A significant rise in net imports occurred, peaking around the mid-2000s. This reflects increased energy consumption and reliance on foreign energy sources. The U.S. experienced growing energy demands driven by economic expansion and technological advancements. This led to higher consumption of oil and natural gas. The U.S. became increasingly reliant on foreign oil, with imports rising significantly.\nMid-2000s to Present: There is a sharp decline in net imports, eventually turning negative. This indicates that the U.S. became a net exporter of primary energy. Factors contributing to this include increased domestic energy production (especially from gas and oil), improved energy efficiency, and shifts towards renewable energy sources. (Source: U.S. Energy Independence)\n\nOverall, the chart illustrates a transition from high dependency on imported energy to a position where the U.S. exports more energy than it imports.\n\n\n3.2.4 Energy Imports vs Energy Consumption\n\n\nCode\nggplot(energy_data_monthly, aes(x=Month)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y=`Primary Energy Imports (Quadrillion Btu)`, color='Primary Energy Imports'), size=0.5) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=`Total Primary Energy Consumption (Quadrillion Btu)`, color='Total Primary Energy Consumption'), size=0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Energy Consumption and Energy Imports',\n    x='Timeline',\n    y='Energy (Quadrillion Btu)',\n    caption = 'Data Source: U.S. Energy Information Association'\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold', color='black'),\n    legend.position = 'bottom',\n    legend.box = 'horizontal',\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(energy_data_annual, aes(x = `Primary Energy Imports (Quadrillion Btu)`, y = `Total Primary Energy Consumption (Quadrillion Btu)`)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = TRUE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Energy Dependency Analysis\",\n    x = \"Primary Energy Imports (Quadrillion Btu)\",\n    y = \"Total Primary Energy Consumption (Quadrillion Btu)\",\n    subtitle = paste(\"Pearson Correlation Coefficient:\", round(cor(energy_data_annual$`Primary Energy Imports (Quadrillion Btu)`, energy_data_annual$`Total Primary Energy Consumption (Quadrillion Btu)`, method = \"pearson\"), 2)),\n    caption = 'Data Source: U.S. Energy Information Association'\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold', color='black'),\n    plot.subtitle =  element_text(hjust=0.5, color='purple')\n  )\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two graphs provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption and import patterns over time and it reveals important trends and relationships.\nConsumption Trends\nTotal Primary Energy Consumption shows a steady upward trajectory from around 6.5 Quadrillion Btu to approximately 7.5 Quadrillion Btu each month starting from January 1973 and ending on August 2024. Notable seasonal fluctuations appear throughout the timeline with regular peaks and troughs. The overall consumption pattern demonstrates consistent growth despite short-term variations\nImport Patterns\nPrimary Energy Imports started at roughly 1.5 Quadrillion Btu each month in the 1970s. Imports peaked around 2005-2010 at approximately 3 Quadrillion Btu each month. A notable decline in imports occurred after 2010, stabilizing at about 2 Quadrillion Btu each month by 2020.\nStatistical Relationship\nThe scatter plot reveals a strong positive correlation between imports and consumption. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.95 indicates an extremely strong linear relationship between consumption and import. The narrow confidence interval (gray shading) suggests high prediction reliability. The regression line shows a clear positive slope, indicating that higher imports generally correspond to higher consumption. Data points cluster tightly around the regression line, particularly in the middle range. The relationship remains consistent across different levels of imports and consumption.\nKey Insights\n- Despite growing total energy consumption, there’s a decreasing reliance on imports in recent years.\n- The gap between consumption and imports has widened over time, suggesting increased domestic energy production or diversification of energy sources.\n- The seasonal variations in consumption are more pronounced than fluctuations in imports, indicating stable import patterns despite varying demand.\n\n\n3.2.5 Trends in Types of Fossil Fuel Production\n\n\nCode\nfossil_fuel &lt;- energy_data_annual |&gt; \n                  select(\n                    `Year`,\n                    `Coal Production (Quadrillion Btu)`,\n                    `Natural Gas (Dry) Production (Quadrillion Btu)`,\n                    `Crude Oil Production (Quadrillion Btu)`,\n                    `Natural Gas Plant Liquids Production (Quadrillion Btu)`\n                  ) |&gt;\n                  pivot_longer(\n                    cols = -Year,\n                    names_to = 'Energy Type',\n                    values_to = 'Production (Quadrillion Btu)'\n                  ) |&gt;\n                  mutate(\n                    `Energy Type` = str_replace_all(`Energy Type`, \" \\\\(Quadrillion Btu\\\\)\", '')\n                  )\n\nggplot(fossil_fuel, aes(x=`Year`, y=`Production (Quadrillion Btu)`, fill=`Energy Type`))+\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +\n  labs(\n    title='Fossil Fuel Production',\n    y='Production (Quadrillion Btu)',\n    x='Year',\n    caption = 'Data Source: U.S. Energy Information Association'\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold', color='black'),\n    legend.position = 'bottom',\n    legend.box = 'horizontal',\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart shows how much fossil fuel was produced from around 1949 to 2023, measured in Quadrillion Btu (British thermal units). The chart uses a stacked area format, meaning each colored section is stacked on top of the others, making it easy to see both individual contributions and the total combined production at any point in time.\nCoal (Red) - The red bars at the top show coal production. It stayed fairly steady increase from 1949 to 1980, then nearly stabilized after 1980 but eventually decreased around late 2010s and the trend continues till now.\nCrude Oil (Green) - The green section represents crude oil production. It grew steadily from 1950 to 1980, remained relatively flat for many years, and then showed another strong increase from around 2010 to 2020.\nNatural Gas (Blue) - The blue section shows dry natural gas production. It has grown consistently over the years, with a particularly sharp increase from 2005 to 2020. It shows the majority of energy needs in United States are fulfilled by Natural Gas.\nNatural Gas Plant Liquids (Purple) - The purple section at the bottom represents natural gas plant liquids production. This has remained the smallest portion throughout the entire period, showing only modest growth.\nThe total fossil fuel production has grown dramatically from about 28 quadrillion Btu in 1949 to nearly 85 quadrillion Btu by 2023. The most dramatic growth happened in the last decade shown on the chart (2010-2020), where all types of fossil fuels, except natural gas plant liquids, showed significant increases in production.\nThe dependency on fossil fuels especially on natural gas is very pronounced in U.S.\n\n\nCode\nfossil_fuel_2023 &lt;- fossil_fuel |&gt; filter(Year==2023)\n\nggplot(fossil_fuel_2023, aes(x='', y=`Production (Quadrillion Btu)`, fill=`Energy Type`)) +\n  geom_bar(stat='identity', width=1) +\n    coord_polar('y', start=0) + \n  labs(\n    title='% Fossil Fuel Production in 2023',\n    y='',\n    x='',\n    fill='Energy Type',\n    caption = 'Data Source: U.S. Energy Information Association'\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold', color='black'),\n    legend.title = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(\n      label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", `Production (Quadrillion Btu)`/sum(`Production (Quadrillion Btu)`) * 100)),\n      position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis pie chart shows how different fossil fuels were produced in the United States during 2023.\n\nNatural gas (dry) was the biggest part, making up 45.4% of all fossil fuel production.\nCrude oil was the second largest at 31.1%.\nCoal made up 13.6%.\nNatural gas plant liquids were the smallest portion at 9.8%.\n\nTogether, all forms of natural gas (dry and liquids) accounted for more than half of all fossil fuel production at 55.2%.\n\n\n3.2.6 Trends in Types of Renewable Energy Production\n\n\nCode\nrenewable_energy &lt;- energy_data_annual |&gt;\n                    select(\n                      `Year`,\n                      `Hydroelectric Power Production (Quadrillion Btu)`,\n                      `Geothermal Energy Production (Quadrillion Btu)`,                                                              \n                      `Solar Energy Production (Quadrillion Btu)`,\n                      `Wind Energy Production (Quadrillion Btu)`,                                                                    \n                      `Biomass Energy Production (Quadrillion Btu)`\n                    ) |&gt;\n                    pivot_longer(\n                      cols=-`Year`,\n                      names_to = 'Energy Type',\n                      values_to = 'Production (Quadrillion Btu)'\n                    ) |&gt;\n                    mutate(\n                      `Energy Type` = str_replace_all(`Energy Type`, ' \\\\(Quadrillion Btu\\\\)', '')\n                    ) |&gt;\n                    mutate(\n                      `Production (Quadrillion Btu)` = ifelse(is.na(`Production (Quadrillion Btu)`), 0, `Production (Quadrillion Btu)`)\n                    )\n\nggplot(renewable_energy, aes(x=`Year`, y=`Production (Quadrillion Btu)`, fill=`Energy Type`))+\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +\n  labs(\n    title='Renewable Energy Production',\n    y='Production (Quadrillion Btu)',\n    x='Year',\n    cpation = 'Data Source: U.S. Energy Information Association'\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold', color='black'),\n    legend.position = 'bottom',\n    legend.box = 'horizontal',\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  ) + \n  guides(\n    fill = guide_legend(nrow=2)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows how renewable energy production has changed from around 1960 to 2020. Let us break down the key observations:\nThe total renewable energy production has significantly increased over time, reaching about 8 quadrillion BTU (British Thermal Units) by 2020. The graph shows a particularly sharp increase from 2000 onwards.\nBiomass Energy (Red)\n- Has consistently been the largest source.\n- Shows steady growth, especially after 2000.\n- Makes up roughly half of all renewable energy production.\nHydroelectric Power (Green)\n- Represents the second-largest source.\n- Has remained relatively stable over the decades.\n- Shows some fluctuations but maintains consistent production levels.\nWind Energy (Orange)\n- Virtually non-existent before 2000.\n- Shows dramatic growth in the last two decades.\n- Becomes a significant contributor by 2020.\nSolar Energy (Purple)\n- Begins to appear noticeably after 2010.\n- Shows rapid recent growth due advancement in technology and good adoption by the government and people.\n- Still represents a smaller portion compared to other sources.\nGeothermal Energy (Blue)\n- Maintains a very small but steady contribution.\n- Shows minimal growth over the entire period.\nThe chart can be divided into 3 time periods as shown below.\n- 1960-1980: Relatively stable production, dominated by biomass and hydroelectric.\n- 1980-2000: Modest growth with similar source distribution.\n- 2000-2020: Rapid expansion with diversification into wind and solar energy.\nThe visualization clearly demonstrates the transition toward a more diverse renewable energy portfolio, with newer technologies like wind and solar becoming increasingly important contributors to the overall energy mix. But the difference between fossil fuels and renewable is very wide. Serious policy change and incentives are required to make the transition to renewable energy.\n\n\nCode\nrenewable_energy_2023 &lt;- renewable_energy |&gt; filter(`Year` == 2023)\n\nggplot(renewable_energy_2023, aes(x='', y=`Production (Quadrillion Btu)`, fill=`Energy Type`)) +\n  geom_bar(stat='identity', width=1) +\n    coord_polar('y', start=0) + \n  labs(\n    title='% Renewable Energy Production in 2023',\n    y='',\n    x='',\n    fill='Energy Type',\n    caption = 'Data Source: U.S. Energy Information Association'\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, face='bold', color='black'),\n    legend.title = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(\n      label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", `Production (Quadrillion Btu)`/sum(`Production (Quadrillion Btu)`) * 100)),\n      position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),\n      color='white'\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pie chart shows the breakdown of renewable energy production in the United States for 2023. Biomass energy is the dominant source and produces more than half of all renewable energy, accounting for 61.2% of total renewable energy production. Wind energy follows as the second-largest contributor at 17.0%, while solar energy represents 10.4% of the total. Hydroelectric power makes up 9.9%, and geothermal energy has the smallest share at 1.4%.\nSupporting renewable energy and reducing reliance on fossil fuels can be achieved by: 1. Investing in Clean Technologies: Allocate funding for solar, wind, hydroelectric, and other renewable energy projects.\n2. Government Policies and Incentives: Implement subsidies, tax credits, and carbon pricing to encourage renewable energy adoption.\n3. Grid Modernization: Upgrade infrastructure to support energy storage and integrate decentralized renewable sources.\n4. Promoting Energy Efficiency: Encourage the use of energy-efficient appliances and buildings to reduce overall demand.\n5.

Energy use regularly peaks at around 3,500 trillion BTU and drops to about 2,000 trillion BTU throughout each year. These peaks correspond to winter months when heating demands are highest, while valleys represent periods of lower energy usage, typically during milder seasons.\nThe blue line shows energy loss, which mirrors the consumption pattern but at a significantly lower level. Energy losses typically fluctuate between 500 and 1,000 trillion BTU. This parallel pattern suggests that energy losses are directly proportional to consumption – when more energy is consumed, more is lost through various inefficiencies.\n\n\n3.3.2 Energy Overview by Commercial Sector\n\n\nCode\nrs_energy_consumed &lt;- xts(x = energy_data_monthly$`Total Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector (Trillion Btu)`, order.by = energy_data_monthly$Month)\nrs_energy_loss &lt;- xts(x = energy_data_monthly$`Commercial Sector Electrical System Energy Losses (Trillion Btu)`, order.by = energy_data_monthly$Month)\n\ndygraph(cbind(rs_energy_consumed, rs_energy_loss), main='Energy Consumed vs Energy Loss (Commercial Sector)') |&gt;\n  dySeries('rs_energy_consumed', label = 'Energy Consumed') |&gt;\n  dySeries('rs_energy_loss', label = 'Energy Loss') |&gt;\n  dyRangeSelector() |&gt;\n  dyOptions(stackedGraph = TRUE, drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2) |&gt;\n  dyAxis(\"x\", label = \"Timeline\") |&gt;\n  dyAxis(\"y\", label = \"Energy (Trillion Btu)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe green line represents the total energy consumed by the commercial sector, measured in trillion BTU (British Thermal Units). Starting from around 1,000 trillion BTU in the 1970s, consumption steadily increased to peak at approximately 2,500 trillion BTU in the mid-2000s. After 2010, the consumption pattern shows more fluctuation but generally maintains a high level around 2,000 trillion BTU.\nThe blue line shows energy losses, which are significantly lower than consumption but follow a similar upward trend. Losses started at about 300 trillion BTU in the 1970s and gradually increased to around 700-800 trillion BTU by the 2010s. These losses likely represent energy wasted through inefficient systems, heat escape, and conversion processes.\nBoth lines show regular up-and-down patterns throughout each year, indicating seasonal variations in energy use. These zigzag patterns are more pronounced in the consumption (green) line, suggesting that commercial energy use is heavily influenced by seasonal factors like heating in winter and cooling in summer.\nToward the end of the graph (2015-2020s), both consumption and losses show a slight downward trend, possibly reflecting improved energy efficiency in the commercial sector or changes in business operations. The gap between consumption and loss has remained relatively consistent in recent years, suggesting that efficiency ratios have stabilized.\n\n\n3.3.3 Energy Overview by Industrial Sector\n\n\nCode\nrs_energy_consumed &lt;- xts(x = energy_data_monthly$`Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector (Trillion Btu)`, order.by = energy_data_monthly$Month)\nrs_energy_loss &lt;- xts(x = energy_data_monthly$`Industrial Sector Electrical System Energy Losses (Trillion Btu)`, order.by = energy_data_monthly$Month)\n\ndygraph(cbind(rs_energy_consumed, rs_energy_loss), main='Energy Consumed vs Energy Loss (Industrial Sector)') |&gt;\n  dySeries('rs_energy_consumed', label = 'Energy Consumed') |&gt;\n  dySeries('rs_energy_loss', label = 'Energy Loss') |&gt;\n  dyRangeSelector() |&gt;\n  dyOptions(stackedGraph = TRUE, drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2) |&gt;\n  dyAxis(\"x\", label = \"Timeline\") |&gt;\n  dyAxis(\"y\", label = \"Energy (Trillion Btu)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe green line at the top shows how much energy industries actually used. The amount typically stays between 2,500 and 3,500 trillion Btu (British thermal units). There are some interesting patterns:\n- A peak around the year 2000, reaching about 3,500 trillion Btu.\n- Some noticeable dips, particularly around 1985 and 2008 due to strong global competition and the global recession respectively. - Regular up and down patterns that might represent seasonal changes.\nThe blue line at the bottom shows energy that was wasted or lost during use. This line is much lower, staying around 500 trillion Btu. The loss is fairly consistent over time, though it shows:\n- A slight increase from 1980 to 2000.\n- A gradual decrease after 2000.\n- Much smaller variations compared to the consumption line.\nThe relationship between energy consumed and lost has remained relatively stable over these 40 years. The gap between the green and blue lines represents the energy that was successfully used for industrial purposes. This shows that industries typically lose about 15-20% of their energy during use, while successfully using about 80-85% of it.\nThe graph reveals that while industrial energy use has fluctuated over time, the efficiency of energy use (shown by the relatively stable loss rate) hasn’t changed dramatically over this period. The graph also shows much less seasonal variations as compared to energy graph of residential and commercial sectors.\nThere are certain dips in the graph like in 1980s, 2008 and 2020. This corresponding to major shifts in industrial sectors due to global crisis like financial crisis of 2008, covid pandemic, etc.\n\n\n3.3.4 Energy Overview by Transportation Sector\n\n\nCode\nrs_energy_consumed &lt;- xts(x = energy_data_monthly$`Total Energy Consumed by the Transportation Sector (Trillion Btu)`, order.by = energy_data_monthly$Month)\nrs_energy_loss &lt;- xts(x = energy_data_monthly$`Electrical System Energy Losses Proportioned to the Transportation Sector (Trillion Btu)`, order.by = energy_data_monthly$Month)\n\ndygraph(cbind(rs_energy_consumed, rs_energy_loss), main='Energy Consumed vs Energy Loss (Transportation Sector)') |&gt;\n  dySeries('rs_energy_consumed', label = 'Energy Consumed') |&gt;\n  dySeries('rs_energy_loss', label = 'Energy Loss') |&gt;\n  dyRangeSelector() |&gt;\n  dyOptions(stackedGraph = TRUE, drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2) |&gt;\n  dyAxis(\"x\", label = \"Timeline\") |&gt;\n  dyAxis(\"y\", label = \"Energy (Trillion Btu)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe green line, representing energy consumed, shows a general upward trend from about 1,500 trillion Btu in 1980 to approximately 2,500 trillion Btu by 2020. This indicates a significant increase in energy consumption in the transportation sector over this period.\n\nThe graph displays regular seasonal fluctuations throughout the years.\n\nA notable peak occurs around 2007-2008, reaching about 2,500 trillion Btu.\n\nA sharp drop is visible around 2020, likely corresponding to the global pandemic.\n\nRecovery appears to occur after the 2020 drop, returning to previous levels.\n\nThe blue line at the bottom of the graph, representing energy loss, remains remarkably constant and close to zero throughout the entire period. This suggests that the transportation sector has maintained consistent energy efficiency levels despite increasing consumption.\nThe graph shows regular up-and-down patterns within each year, indicating seasonal changes in transportation energy use. These fluctuations appear to be fairly consistent in amplitude throughout the measured period.\nThis visualization effectively demonstrates how transportation energy demands have grown substantially over the past 40 years, while energy loss has remained minimal. The data suggests improvements in energy efficiency technologies have helped maintain low energy losses despite increasing consumption levels.",

Several notable patterns emerge:\nPetroleum consistently remains the highest emitter throughout the period, showing significant fluctuations with peaks around 1980 and 2005-2010, followed by a notable decline and slight recovery toward 2020.\nCoal emissions (shown in blue) demonstrate a steady increase from 1975 until around 2005, after which they experience a dramatic decline, particularly steep after 2010. By 2020, coal emissions have dropped to their lowest levels in the recorded period.\nNatural Gas emissions (orange line) show a general upward trend, particularly accelerating after 2005. By the end of the period, natural gas emissions have surpassed coal, becoming the second-largest source of CO2 emissions.\nMotor Gasoline (purple line) maintains relatively stable emissions throughout the period, with a slight increase during the 1990s and 2000s, followed by a modest decline.\nOther sources (yellow line) and Aviation/Kerosene (red and green lines) contribute relatively minor amounts to overall emissions, remaining fairly constant throughout the period.\nKey Transitions: The most significant change in the data is the dramatic shift in the energy landscape after 2010, marked by:\n- A sharp decline in coal emissions.\n- A concurrent rise in natural gas emissions.\n- A moderate decrease in petroleum emissions.\nThe overall emission patterns have significant implications for climate change:\n- The shift from coal to natural gas represents a partial improvement, as natural gas produces about half the CO2 emissions per unit of energy compared to coal.\n- Despite the decline in coal usage, the total emissions remain high enough to contribute significantly to global warming.\n- The persistent high levels of petroleum emissions, combined with rising natural gas usage, continue to pose challenges for meeting climate goals.\nThis comprehensive emissions profile suggests that while there have been some positive changes in the energy mix, particularly the reduction in coal usage, the United States continues to produce substantial CO2 emissions that contribute to global climate change. Further reductions across all fuel types would be necessary to meaningfully address climate change concerns.",

    "text": "In this project, we investigated the general trends and evolution in energy production and consumption in the United States in the past 70 years. Despite the numerous efforts in advertising for renewable energy, our project shows that while the energy production almost tripled over the last 7 decades, the majority of the energy is produced by non-sustainable fossil fuels. It suggests that our pursuit for more efficient and reliable sources of renewable energy is far from reaching the goal. The CO2 emissions has decreased for some fossil fuels like coal but overall it is still increasing due to rapid increase in consumption of other fossil fuels like natural gas and petroleum. Besides this result, our project also provides insights on the current sources of energy we rely on and the geographical distribution of major production and consumption sources across the United States.\nMoreover, our findings stress the critical importance of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy sources. While renewable energy sources such as wind, hydro, solar and biomass have made notable advances in terms of capacity and efficiency, their integration into the overall energy mix remains limited. Overcoming the barriers to widespread adoption—such as storage limitations, intermittent generation, and infrastructure challenges—requires continued innovation, substantial investments, and supportive policy frameworks. Furthermore, addressing public awareness and fostering behavioral changes are essential to driving demand for renewable options at both the individual and industrial levels. Our findings also highlight the need for a balanced energy transition that considers equity. Policies and investments must address disparities in resource availability and access to renewable technologies across regions.\nOur project focuses primarily on the energy production and consumption over years and across different sources. Our graphs show that there are other hidden patterns, for example, seasonal cycle in production and consumption, within the energy data that wait to be explored. Further investigation can also aim to focus on factors, like climate or economy, that affect the changes and trends of the rise and fall of different sectors of energy production. Those possible explorations will allow the readers to obtain a better picture of the current and future state of energy produced within the country and the progress toward sustainability.\nIn conclusion, while the progress toward a renewable energy future is underway, the path remains long and complex. Achieving true sustainability in energy production and consumption will demand coordinated efforts across technology, policy, and public engagement. Through continued exploration of patterns and influencing factors within the energy landscape, we can better understand how to accelerate this transition and achieve a sustainable, equitable, and resilient energy future.",
