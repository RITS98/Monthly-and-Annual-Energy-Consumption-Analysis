The history of energy production reflects human cultural and technological advancements, with fossil fuels dominating for decades despite their environmental and finite resource concerns. This has spurred interest in sustainable alternatives like renewable energy and nuclear power. These shifts have driven broader societal, economic, and geopolitical changes. This project focuses on analyzing trends in energy production and consumption in the U.S. over recent decades, aiming to visualize patterns, seasonal fluctuations, and the evolving emphasis on various energy sources to better understand and predict future energy priorities.
