# Conclusion

In this project, we investigated the general trends and evolution in energy production and consumption in the United States in the past 70 years. Despite the numerous efforts in advertising for renewable energy, our project shows that while the energy production almost tripled over the last 7 decades, the majority of the energy is produced by non-sustainable fossil fuels. It suggests that our pursuit for more efficient and reliable sources of renewable energy is far from reaching the goal. The CO2 emissions has decreased for some fossil fuels like coal but overall it is still increasing due to rapid increase in consumption of other fossil fuels like natural gas and petroleum. Besides this result, our project also provides insights on the current sources of energy we rely on and the geographical distribution of major production and consumption sources across the United States.

Moreover, our findings stress the critical importance of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy sources. While renewable energy sources such as wind, hydro, solar and biomass have made notable advances in terms of capacity and efficiency, their integration into the overall energy mix remains limited. Overcoming the barriers to widespread adoption—such as storage limitations, intermittent generation, and infrastructure challenges—requires continued innovation, substantial investments, and supportive policy frameworks. Furthermore, addressing public awareness and fostering behavioral changes are essential to driving demand for renewable options at both the individual and industrial levels. Our findings also highlight the need for a balanced energy transition that considers equity. Policies and investments must address disparities in resource availability and access to renewable technologies across regions.

Our project focuses primarily on the energy production and consumption over years and across different sources. Our graphs show that there are other hidden patterns, for example, seasonal cycle in production and consumption, within the energy data that wait to be explored. Further investigation can also aim to focus on factors, like climate or economy, that affect the changes and trends of the rise and fall of different sectors of energy production. Those possible explorations will allow the readers to obtain a better picture of the current and future state of energy produced within the country and the progress toward sustainability.

In conclusion, while the progress toward a renewable energy future is underway, the path remains long and complex. Achieving true sustainability in energy production and consumption will demand coordinated efforts across technology, policy, and public engagement. Through continued exploration of patterns and influencing factors within the energy landscape, we can better understand how to accelerate this transition and achieve a sustainable, equitable, and resilient energy future.
